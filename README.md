## Overview

This project is focused on implementing and testing a currency converter application. The application is designed to convert amounts between different currencies: USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, CHF, and AUD, accepting amounts between 0 and 1,000,000. The project involves both black box and white box testing methods to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application.

## Development

The project's source code is available on GitHub. You can access the repository using the following link:
[TP4---IFT3913 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/emilybazilesupplice/TP4---IFT3913)

## How to Run the test

The tests are located in the src/test/java/currencyConverter folder. There are four different test files:

* CurrencyBoiteBlanche.java
* CurrencyBoiteNoir.java
* MainWindowBoiteBlanche.java
* MainWindowBoiteNoir.java

If you are using JUnit 5 and Maven, you can run the tests from the command line using the following command in the project root directory:

    mvn test

This command will automatically find and run all tests in your project.

Alternatively, if you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can run the tests as follows:

1. Right-click on the currencyConverter folder in the test directory.
2. Select 'Run Tests'.

Make sure your IDE is configured to use JUnit 5 for running the tests.
